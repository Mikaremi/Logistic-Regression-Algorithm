# Logistic-Regression-Algorithm
Logistic Regression is a Machine Learning classification algorithm that is used to predict the probability of a categorical dependent variable. In logistic regression, the dependent variable is a binary variable that contains data coded as 1 (yes, success, etc.) or 0 (no, failure, etc.).
## Problem Statement
The Hr_Data_Analytics dataset contains information about employees who worked in a company.
This dataset contains columns: Satisfactory Level, Number of Project, Average Monthly Hours, Time Spend Company, Promotion Last 5 Years, Department, Salary.
## Objectives
* Do Exploratory Data analysis to figure out which variables have a direct and clear impact on employee retention (i.e. whether they leave the company or continue to work)
* Plot bar charts showing the impact of employee salaries on retention
* Plot bar charts showing a correlation between department and employee retention
* Build a logistic regression model using variables that were narrowed down in step 1
* Measure the accuracy of the model

## Libraries used
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
